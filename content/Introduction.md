Introduction
============

My name is Brendan McCulley. I am a senior at the University of Kentucky majoring in Information and Communications Technology and minoring in Computer Science. My hobbies include video games and music. I have played the trumpet since I was 11 years old and I have been playing video games longer then that. I was a member of UK's marching and pep bands for my first four years there.
