I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have learned a lot this week about what web content management is about. Specifically all of the different roles that are involved in the whole process like editor, developer, administrator, etc. Personally I think the development part of content management seems pretty fun. 


I can describe and compare content management systems. <br>
------------------------------------------------------

I now have an understanding of content and content management but not content management systems. Knowing about content management and the workflows around it seems like a large part of CMS but I have a feeling that there is more we are going to get to later in this class.


I can manage content using established workflows. <br>
-------------------------------------------------

After this week I am much more familiar with the tools and knowledge to make effective workflows. For example, Using the planner in Microsoft Teams was very useful as it let you assign specific people to tasks, set deadlines for task, add detailed descriptions for each task, and it had a progress bar that show if you haven't started, its in progress, or you have completed the task.


I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------



I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
