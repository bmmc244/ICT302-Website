<h>2I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.</h2>

I am still a little unclear on what exactly a web content management system is, but as the semester goes on hopefully I will learn more and more about this topic.

<h2>I can describe and compare content management systems.</h2>

I am still unfamilar on what exactly content management systems are so I can't yet accomplish this statement.

<h2>I can manage content using established workflows.</h2>

For this topic I feel like I have made progress on this in the first week. Setting up our different technologies such as github, Hugo, and Netlify all seem to be important tools in establishing and completing a workflow in order to manage content. This week the content I managed was my first Hugo site.

<h2>I can identify and employ technologies realted to content management.</h2> 

Github seems like the most useful technology we have learned about yet. In terms of content management Github is an extremely useful tool in helping manage different versions of what ever content you are working on.

<h2>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.</h2>

Although I haven't done a lot of self research for this specific class yet, I am very familar with how to find all kinds of helpful resources on any pretty much any topic through the web.
