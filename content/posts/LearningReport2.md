I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
After this week I have a much better understanding of what content is. According to Barkers defition given in class, content needs to go through an editorial process and be intended for human consumption. This defintion has given me a much more clear and defined perspective on what content is as it related to this class.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
I am still a little unsure about this statement. I am more familar with what content is but I am still a little confused on what the exact definition of what a content management system would be.

I can manage content using established workflows.
This week I have gotten more familiar with github and netlify which makes it much easier to manage the content that I post on my Hugo website.


I can identify and employ technologies realted to content management.
I haven't learned about any new technologies this week, but I am becoming much more familiar with github, hugo, and netlify.


I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
Two new resources that I have acquired this week that help me learn about content management outside of class are the daring fireball website which gives a great overview of markdown and w3 which gives a great overview about html and css.
